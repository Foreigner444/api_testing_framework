## 🎓 For Instructors & Mentors

### Teaching Tips:
1. Start with Project 1, Lesson 1.1
2. Let learners type code (no copy/paste)
3. Encourage experimentation
4. Celebrate small wins
5. Answer questions patiently
6. Use analogies liberally

### Pacing Recommendations:
- **Beginners**: 1 lesson per day (3-4 weeks for Project 1)
- **Intermediate**: 2 lessons per day (2 weeks for Project 1)
- **Advanced**: Review/skim, focus on new concepts

### Assessment Ideas:
- Can they explain concepts in their own words?
- Can they write tests without looking at examples?
- Do they understand WHY, not just HOW?
- Can they debug errors independently?

---
