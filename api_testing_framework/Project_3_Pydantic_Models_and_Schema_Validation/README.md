# Project 3: Pydantic Models & Schema Validation

## 🎯 What You'll Build
A **type-safe API testing framework** using Pydantic models for automatic validation of httpx responses. You'll learn to catch API contract violations instantly and write tests that are self-documenting and maintainable.

## 🛠️ Skills You'll Learn
- Creating Pydantic models for API requests and responses
- Field types, validation, and constraints
- Required vs optional fields with type safety
- Nested models and complex data structures
- Custom validators for business logic
- Parsing httpx responses directly to models
- Handling validation errors gracefully
- JSON schema generation
- Integration with async httpx
- Model factories and patterns
