# Lesson 6.6: Basic Authentication with httpx

## A. Concept Overview

### What & Why
**HTTP Basic Authentication** sends username:password encoded in Base64. Simple auth method for internal APIs.

### Analogy
Basic auth is like a library card with ID and PIN—simple, effective for low-security scenarios.

---

## B. Code Implementation

```python
import httpx

# Built-in Basic auth (recommended)
client = httpx.Client(
    base_url="https://api.example.com",
    auth=("username", "password")
)

response = client.get("/data")


# Testing
def test_basic_auth():
    client = httpx.Client(
        base_url="https://httpbin.org",
        auth=("user", "pass")
    )
    response = client.get("/basic-auth/user/pass")
    assert response.status_code == 200
```

---

## C. Connect & Apply

Test with httpbin's basic-auth endpoint.

---

## D. Common Stumbling Blocks

**Mistake:** Using over HTTP (not HTTPS)
**Fix:** Always HTTPS with Basic auth

---

## 🎯 Key Takeaways

✅ Tuple (user, pass) for Basic auth  
✅ Base64 is NOT encryption  
✅ Use HTTPS always
