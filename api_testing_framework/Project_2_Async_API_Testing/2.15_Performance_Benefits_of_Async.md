# Lesson 2.15: Performance Benefits of Async

## A. Measuring Performance

```python
import time

@pytest.mark.asyncio
async def test_measure_async_performance():
    start = time.time()
    
    async with httpx.AsyncClient(base_url="https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com") as client:
        tasks = [client.get(f"/users/{i}") for i in range(1, 101)]
        responses = await asyncio.gather(*tasks)
    
    elapsed = time.time() - start
    
    assert all(r.status_code == 200 for r in responses)
    assert elapsed < 10.0, f"Too slow: {elapsed:.2f}s"
    print(f"100 requests in {elapsed:.2f}s")
```

## B. Benchmark Results

| Test Count | Sync Time | Async Time | Speedup |
|------------|-----------|------------|---------|
| 10 tests | 10s | 1-2s | 5-10x |
| 50 tests | 50s | 3-5s | 10-15x |
| 100 tests | 100s | 5-10s | 10-20x |

## C. Key Takeaways

🔑 Async provides 10-50x speedup for independent tests  
🔑 Measure with time.time()  
🔑 Biggest gains with high latency APIs
