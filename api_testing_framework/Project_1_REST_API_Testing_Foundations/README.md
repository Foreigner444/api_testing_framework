# Project 1: REST API Testing Foundations

## Overview

Welcome to **Project 1: REST API Testing Foundations**! This project teaches you the fundamentals of API testing using modern Python tools: **pytest** and **httpx**.

By the end of this project, you'll have a complete REST API test suite with 100% endpoint coverage and proper response validation.

---

## What You'll Build

A comprehensive REST API test suite that:
- ✅ Tests all HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE)
- ✅ Uses modern httpx library (faster and more powerful than requests)
- ✅ Validates status codes and response data
- ✅ Handles query parameters and headers
- ✅ Follows industry best practices
- ✅ Is ready to expand into a full framework

---

## Tools & Technologies

- **Python 3.10+**: Modern, readable, powerful programming language
- **pytest >=8.0**: Industry-standard testing framework
- **httpx >=0.27**: Modern HTTP client with sync/async support

## Learning Path

### Phase 1: Foundations (Lessons 1.1-1.4)
Learn the theory behind API testing, REST principles, HTTP methods, and status codes.

### Phase 2: Tools Setup (Lessons 1.5-1.7)
Set up your development environment with pytest and httpx.

### Phase 3: Hands-On Testing (Lessons 1.8-1.13)
Write real API tests for all HTTP methods with httpx.

### Phase 4: Advanced Topics (Lessons 1.14-1.18)
Master response validation, JSON parsing, headers, parameters, and timeouts.

### Phase 5: Best Practices (Lesson 1.19)
Learn industry best practices for maintainable, scalable API tests.

## Success Criteria

You'll know you've mastered this project when you can:

1. Explain what REST APIs are and why they matter
2. Write pytest tests for any HTTP endpoint
3. Use httpx to make sync HTTP requests
4. Validate status codes, headers, and response bodies
5. Handle different response formats (JSON, text, etc.)
6. Test error scenarios (404, 400, 500, etc.)
7. Configure httpx.Client with base URLs, headers, and timeouts
8. Follow API testing best practices

## Tips for Success

💡 **Take your time** - Understanding is more important than speed  
💡 **Practice actively** - Type the code, don't just read it  
💡 **Run tests frequently** - See results immediately  
💡 **Experiment** - Try changing values, break things, learn!  
💡 **Ask questions** - Your mentor is here to help  
💡 **Review often** - Go back to earlier lessons as needed
