# Project 4: Test Data Generation with Faker

## 🎯 What You'll Build
A **robust test data generation system** using the Faker library, seamlessly integrated with Pydantic models and httpx requests. You'll master creating realistic, dynamic test data that makes your API tests more comprehensive, maintainable, and representative of real-world scenarios.

## 🛠️ Skills You'll Learn
- Installing and using Faker library
- Generating realistic names, addresses, emails, phone numbers
- Working with dates, times, and internet data
- Localization and custom providers
- Seeding for reproducible test data
- Combining Faker with Pydantic models
- Using Faker data in httpx requests
- Factory pattern for test data
- Factory Boy integration
- Pytest fixtures with Faker
- Data builders and parametrization
- Production-ready test data strategies
